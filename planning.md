# STUDENT BUDGETING AI 

</header>

This ai will take in a student's major (maybe schedule also?) and show what classes they MUST take

This will be done using a dataset that will compile a list of UIUC grainger engineering school's majors and their corresponding prerequisites

- Will be for incoming freshmen as they all need the same general education requirements
- Will omit classes that are completely useless to the major - thus saving the student money
- Cost per class will be calculated, maybe credit hour options can be shown?

the AI will intake school name and gives back a list of opportunities for the user in saving money to pay for their tuition 

the dataset we create will then include name of the school, and the name of opporunity in each category (scholarship, grant, jobs, paid internships)

- MEETING WITH MS BELLITO on what students have the most questions about related to college financing
