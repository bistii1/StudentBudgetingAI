# STUDENT BUDGETING AI 

</header>

This ai will take in a student's major (maybe schedule also?) and show what classes they MUST take

This will be done using a dataset that will compile a list of UIUC grainger engineering school's majors and their corresponding prerequisites

- Will be for incoming freshmen as they all need the same general education requirements
- Will omit classes that are completely useless to the major - thus saving the student money
- Cost per class will be calculated, maybe credit hour options can be shown?
